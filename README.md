# AnalysisandDesign

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem for this course was to make a print out of a set number of courses with the least amount of runtime between different data structures.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by looking at how the information would need to be seperated to be the most effective and also not be time consuming when searching.
This is why understand different data structures is important because if you do not understand how your data needs to be seperated you can create a lot of
unnesscary work not only for your program but also for you.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
The biggest roadblock I encountered was trying to figure out which data structure would work the best for the information I was provided. I solved this by looking
at each data structure and how it worked through the informaitont hat would be held within it. With this approach i was able to see how the information would be
searched and compiled when doing different operations.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project has be reevalute not only how to program different things but to always look at which data structure is best for the information I am given.
Prior to this project I only used one type of data structure and looked back many assignments would have been easier to work through if I would have used
a different data structure than what I actually used.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
COMMENTS!!! it may seem like a such simple thing but going of just my psuedocode to begin with made it very hard to trace back through steps but also made it difficult
to pick up where I left off. By adding comments after almost every section it was easier to track what everything should be doing and how it interacted with other parts
of my program. This made it easier to set down and pick up along with tracing any errors that may have occured further down the code.
